      <h1>What causes Global Warming?</h1>
      <p>One thing: The Greenhouse Effect. The Greenhouse Effect is a natural process. However, what is not natural
        about it right now is the fast rate at which it is happening. This is due to the abundance of greenhouse gases.
        Here are some greenhouse gases and its sources:</p>
      <h2>1. Carbon Dioxide from Deforestation</h2>
      <p>-Forests are vital for the survival of all organisms as they absorb Carbon dioxide and produce oxygen, which we
        breathe in.</p>
      <p>-However, forests are being cut down for agriculture, land and timber.</p>
      <h2>2. Cholororfluorocarbons (CFCs)</h2>
      <p>-Many industrial and maufacturing processes produce synthetic chemicals such as CFCs.</p>
      <p>-These include: propellants in aerosol spray cans (ex Lysol) foam plastics,foam insulations, cleaning solvents
        in electronics, fluids in refrigeration and A/C</p>
      <h2>3.Methane</h2>
      <p>-When organic waste (ex food) rots, it gives off large amounts of a powerful gas called Methane. Methane is
        derived from: swamps, garbage dumps, coal mining etc.</p>
