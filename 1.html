    <h1> Why be concerned about global warming?</h1>
    <h2>The Consequences of Global Warming</h2>
    <p>There are many consequences related Global Warming but here are 3 concerning problems:
    </p>
    <h2>1. Human Health and Comfort</h2>
    <p>-Because atmospheric temperatures have been rapidly rising (aka Gloabl Warming), the extreme heat can cause health risk, especially to eldery. Example: France 2003, heat killed 11,000 people.</p>
    <p>-The rising temperature will increase the area that insects can spread. Example: Diseases trapped in ice caps may be released if permafrost melts due to high temperatures, furthur increasing our risk of exposure to life threatening viruses.</p>
    <h2>2. Changes in Agricultural Yields.</h2>
    <p>-Inrease in temperature can result in little water due to drought like conditions and this will negatively affect the crop yields. Negative crop yield may lead to food shortages and high prices, making food imports more costly and supplies uncertain.</p>
    <h2>3. Urban Air Pollution</h2>
    <p>-As temperatures increase, more air conditioning units are being used and therefore more energy particularly fossil fuels. This will increase the amount of carbon dioxide and reduce osygen intake, putting people's health at risk.</p>
